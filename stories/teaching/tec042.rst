Example of Pepper's ghost effect:
    The haunted mansion at disney land uses the effect for the ball room
    and many other scenes. Scroll down to the video with the caption
    "Look at the Grand Hall with the lights on in this quick video
    clip." `video <http://www.doombuggies.com/media_video.php>`__
    Read more about the effect on this

Examples of aliasing
    Helicopter blades that "appear" to be stationary.
