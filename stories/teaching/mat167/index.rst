   <h2><font color="green">HELPFUL TIPS</font></h2>

   At this point in the semester some of you may be struggling a little. Don't be intimidated by the fact that the HW is not easy, I don't think it is easy for anyone. Statistics is a difficult class that requires a significant amount of studying outside of the lectures. Here are some tips to help you successfully approach this course.


   Here are a few thoughts that might help you out (you may already be doing some of them).
   1. Before you start the HW, re-read the lecture and make your own summary sheet of the most important points adding any explanations necessary so that it makes sense when you refer to it later. Don't rely on using my summary at the end of the lectures, making your own will help reinforce what is important. Make sure you can do the example problems, try them out as you go.
   1.  Next, read over the book chapter. For the example problems, the book sometimes presents them in 3 ways (1) using tables, (2) using the TI calculators, (3) and using the authors free software. For those problems, just read over the method that uses the tables, but use R instead of the tables. If it's not clear how to use R, refer back to the lecture, I typically have a similar example.
   1.  Now start the HW. If you are stuck on a HW problem and don't know where to start, scan through the lecture notes and the book chapter to find a similar example problem. There is almost always an example problem similar to the HW problem that you can use to help guide you. (This is a really useful tip for all math classes).
   1.  After completing the HW, go back over it and add anything else to your summary sheet that you have discovered is important.
   1.  If you still don't feel like you have mastered the material, do more problems from the book. I typically don't assign all the odd problems, so do more of them and always check your answers against the solutions in the back of the book.
   1. If you are stuck on a problem, you can always email me for help. Tell me what you have done, show me your work, and explain where you are stuck.

   When it comes time to study for an exam it shouldn't be too overwhelming since you have made summary sheets.
   * When studying for midterm exams,  don't forget the old final exams are cumulative so look at them for more practice problems.
   * It also helps to meet up with other people to study for exams. You can discuss problems that you are having trouble with and find out what others think will be on the test.

Resources
=========

Quick Reference Sheet:
----------------------

-  `Equation Sheet & R Commands <EquationSheet.pdf>`__

R Statistics Software
---------------------

Using R on Campus:
    **R is on a few computers in the Academic Commons Computer Lab**
    (2nd floor Santa Catalina building). Just go into the computer lab
    and ask Jody or Dennis (one of the lab managers) where the computers
    are. Printers are also available in this lab.
To install R:
    Visit the `R Resources page <../../Resources/R_Statistics/>`__.
Basic R usage and examples:
    `R Basics page <../../Resources/R_Statistics/RBasics.html>`__
R Data Sets:
    -  `Triola Book Data Page <bookData.html>`__

    -  `Class Survey Data Page <ClassData.html>`__

    -  See quick reference sheet or R intro lecture for info on how to
       use the data sets.

Technical Notes On R:
    When you start a new problem, it's best to delete all the variables
    to ensure you don't accidentally use old data, just type
    ``rm(list=ls())``. Note that you will need to reload the book data
    if you need it.
    When you close R, you do not need to save the workspace if it asks.
    Saving the workspace just saves the variables you have defined.

3.  Tue, Jan 27

    **DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS**

    **Summarizing & graphing data.** (Sections 2.1-2.4)

    -  Lecture:\ `Handout <LH_LEC.0210.DescStats.Graphs.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       -  **From this point forward if the book has the TI symbol next
          to a problem, use R to do it.**
       -  **As always, make sure to include your plots made with R in
          the HW.**
       -  If you get stuck using R take a look at `these R
          examples. </Resources/R_Statistics/RBasics.html>`__

       1. Sec 2.2: 1-17 odds (do 17 by hand)
       2. Sec 2.3: 1, 3.
       3. Additional Problem for 2.3: Use R to make two histograms: one
          of the male heights and of the female heights in the Appendix
          B Data Set 1 (``Mhealth`` and ``Fhealth`` tables in R).
          Include both of the histograms in your HW. Then write a
          paragraph discussing the differences between the male and
          female heights that you can see from the histograms (ie.
          center, variation, shape, outliers, min, max). Do either of
          the histograms have a distribution that is approximately
          normal?

          HINTS: If you are having trouble getting the book data, see
          the R intro lecture or look at the back of the quick reference
          sheet. See the top part of this page to download the data
          sets.

       4. Sec 2.4: 1-4, 9 (use R), 13 (just sketch by hand), 17 (use R),
          19 (use R)

          Hint for 19: to make a plot with Both lines and points rather
          than a scatter plot use the optional argument ``type="b"`` for
          the plot function. ex. ``plot(t, y, type="b")``. The time
          vector ``t`` goes from 1990 to 2000. A quick way to make ``t``
          is to use this shortcut: ``t=1990:2000``.

       <!-- Use this as a catchup day if needed. This is a short lecture. Can get ahead too. (Spring 09, this worked perfect as catchup day from last lecture) -->

    **Summation Notation.**

    -  Lecture:
       `Handout <LH_LEC.0130.Intro.SummationNotation.pdf>`__
    -  Homework: (If you need more explanation and practice with
       summation notation: `see this
       page <http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/math/summation.html>`__ )

       1. `Summation HW <HW.Summation.pdf>`__

5.  Tue, Feb 3

    **Measures of center.** (Sections 3.1-3.2)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0220.DescStats.Center.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec 3.2: 1-9 odds, 13, 15, 21, 23, 25, 29 (Use R if the
          problem has TI by it from now on.)

          Hint for 21: to get the first set of differences use:

          ::

              x=WEATHER$HIGH-WEATHER$PREDICTE

          You can find the second set of differences in the same way
          once you figure out the correct column name. (I admit the
          author’s column names are not that good).

          Hint for 23: to get the pennies for before 1983:

          ::

              x=Coins$WEIGHT[Coins$TYPE=="Pre-1983 Pennies"]

          To find the post 1983 pennies use the same method but take a
          look at the ``Coins`` table to see what they are called and
          then modify the above statement.

          Hint on 29 b: ``mean(x, trim=0.10)``

6.  Thur, Feb 5

       3. Additional problem: Use the following code to make two
          boxplots for comparing gender against bear weight and length.
          Then use the boxplots to discuss and compare the distribution
          of lengths and weights of bears in terms of their gender.
          (Make sure the book data is loaded into R first)

          ::

              boxplot(Bears$LENGTH ~ Bears$SEX, main="Comparison of bear length")
              boxplot(Bears$WEIGHT ~ Bears$SEX, main="Comparison of bear weight")

    **Counting & Binomial distribution.** (Sections 4.7, 5.3-5.4)

    -  Lecture: `Handout A <LH_LEC.0320.Prob.Perms.pdf>`__,
       `Handout B <LH_LEC.0410.RandVars.Binomial.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec 4.7: 1, 5, 7, 9, 13
       2. Sec 5.3: 1, 3, every other odd 5-33, 35 (If the book says to
          use a table in the appendix, use ``dbinom`` in R instead.)
       3. Sec 5.4: 1, 3, every other odd 5-17, 19

14. Thur, Mar 5

    **Intro to the normal distribution.** (Sections 6.1-6.2)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0420.RandVars.Normal.pdf>`__
    -  Homework

       1. Sec 6.2: 1-4, 5-39 odds (most of these are easy if you use
          ``pnorm`` and ``qnorm`` R function.). **You must make sketches
          to show the area.**

          NOTE: From this point onward, if the book says to use a lookup
          table in Appendix A, use R instead. (You won't be given tables
          on the tests.)

          HINT: If you use the technique I used in class, you don’t need
          to find z scores OR use the table in the back of the book. If
          the question refers to data that has a standard normal
          distribution, then it has a normal distribution with a mean=0
          and a standard deviation=1.

          For example, to do 6.2 #10, it says to find the probability a
          thermometer has a reading less than -2.50 if the readings have
          a standard normal distribution. Thus we want to find
          P(x<-2.50) where x has a standard normal distribution. In R
          you would type:

          ::

              > pnorm(-2.50, mean=0, sd=1)
              0.006209665

          So the probability is only 0.00621!

    **HYPOTHESIS TESTING**

    **Intro to hypothesis testing** (Sections 8.1-8.2)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0600.HypTest.IntroProp.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec. 8.2: 1-43 odds (skip 17-23). You don't need to find
          critical values. However, if the book asks you to find the
          test statistic, find that using the equation.

          Hint for 29-36. If you have the test statistic and it's a
          z-score, then use the cumulative probability distribution for
          the standard normal ``pnorm`` and find the tail area. See the
          section on **p-value** in the notes, it also discusses what to
          do.

    **Testing a claim about a proportion** (Section 8.3)

    -  Lecture: Continuation of last lecture handout.
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec. 8.3: 1-3 odds, 5(c,d,e), 9, 15, 19, 23

          Note 1: You **do not** need to find the test statistic or
          critical values. We are using the p-values.

          Note 2: R uses the continuity correction for more accurate
          p-values. Your p-values and test statistics will differ from
          the book's answers by a few percent. The following are a few
          of the p-values you will get with R to help you verify your
          work: Q5: p-value = 0.9114, Q9: p-value < 2.2e-16, Q15:
          p-value = 0.5395.

    **MIDTERM II (Chapters 5-8 and 4.7)**

26. Tue, April 21

    **Inferences about two proportions** (Sections 9.1-9.2)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0620.HypTest.2Prop.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec. 9.2: 1-7 odds, 15, 17, 19, 21, 25

          Note that R uses the continuity correction so the p-values
          will differ by a few percent from the book's.

27. Thur, April 23

    **Inferences about two means & matched pairs** (Section 9.3-9.4)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0630.HypTest.2Means.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec. 9.3: 1-7 odds, 23, 25, 27, 28

          Hint for 27: Use the ``Coins`` table, to get the quarters for
          before 1964:

          ::

              pre=Coins$WEIGHT[Coins$TYPE=="Pre-1964 Quarters"]

          To find the post 1964 quarters use the same method but take a
          look at the ``Coins`` table to see what they are called and
          then modify the above statement. The command
          ``summary(Coins)`` is helpful to find the categories.

          Hint for 28: Use the ``Cola`` table. Just figure out which two
          columns you need.

       2. Sec. 9.4: 1, 3, 5 (manually find the test statistic & p-value
          only), 13, 15, 17 (b-c), 19

28. Tue, April 28

    **MODELING AND TESTING RELATIONSHIPS**

    **Correlation** (Section 10.1-10.2)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0700.Models.LinCor.pdf>`__
    -  Homework: **Include scatter plots for each set of data that you
       find r**

       1. Sec. 10.2: 1-11 odds, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35

29. Thur, April 30

    **Regression** (Section 10.3)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0710.Models.Regression.pdf>`__
    -  Homework: **Make sure to determine if r is significant first (via
       hypothesis test) SHOW WORK. Include scatter plots with regression
       line and residual plots.**

       1. Sec. 10.3: 1-11 odds, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33

          Hint for 5 and 7: you will need to determine if the linear
          correlation coefficient is significant. Since r and n are
          already given just use the test statistic equation to manually
          find the p-value.

    **Variation and prediction intervals, multiple regression** (Section
    10.4-10.5)

    -  Lecture: Continuation of regression lecture.
    -  Homework: No HW. These sections are optional course material.
       However, I highly recommend you read them.

30. Tue, May 5

    **Contingency tables** (Section 11.3)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0640.HypTest.IndepHomog.pdf>`__
    -  Homework: Note that R uses the Yate's continuity correction, so
       your P-values may differ slightly from the book's.

       1. Sec. 11.3: 1-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 21

31. Thur, May 7

    **ANOVA I** (Section 12.1)

    -  Lecture: `Handout <LH_LEC.0800.Models.ANOVA.pdf>`__
    -  Homework:

       1. Sec. 12.2: 1-4, 5 (skip d), 9

    **ANOVA II** (Section 12.2)

    -  Lecture: Continuation of last lecture handout.
    -  Homework: Don't type in the data for 11-14 manually, download
       `Chapter 12 Data File <ANOVAdata.html>`__ and load it
       into R (just like the book data), it has data for each problem.
       The table name is listed next to each problem. Also, don't forget
       to **include the boxplots**.

       1. Sec. 12.2: 11 ``car.crash`` (p-val=0.421), 12 ``car.crash``
          (p-val=0.296), 13 ``stress`` (p=val=0.091), 14 ``skulls``
          (p-val=0.0305), 16 (p-val=0.0369)

34. Tue, May 19

    **FINAL EXAM Chapters 1-12** (2 hours - early class start time)

    **8:10 am to 10:10 am**

    If you would like your final exam back, turn in a self addressed
    stamped envelope with 2 first class stamps affixed with your final
    exam. Once the exams are graded I will mail back those I have
    envelopes for. If you don't provide an envelope your exam will be
    shredded for your privacy.
