A custom IR spot scanning experiment was constructed to project subpixel spots
on a mercury cadmium telluride focal plane array (FPA). The hardware consists
of an FPA in a liquid nitrogen cooled Dewar, high precision motorized stages,
a custom aspheric lens, and a 1.55 and 3.39 μm laser source. By controlling the
position and intensity of the spot, characterizations of cross talk, saturation,
blooming, and (indirectly) the minority carrier lifetime were performed. My
contribution was the design of the custom aspherical optics that enabled
a diffraction limited spot while still being easy to fabricate. You can read
the full details in the `paper </Papers/2012FocalPlane.pdf>`__.
