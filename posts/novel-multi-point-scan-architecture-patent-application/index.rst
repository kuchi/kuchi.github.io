This is a patent application that arose from my
`dissertation </Papers/2009_TanbakuchiDissertation.pdf>`__
and `journal publication <2009_JBO_Monte_Carlo_Tanbakuchi>`__ where I was able
to demonstrate through monte-carlo modeling that
a slit scan system could be improved by making a small modification so that it
becomes a multi-point scan system.

Citation: A. Gimitro, A. Rouse, A. Tanbakuchi,
*"Novel Multi-Point Scan Architecture,"* Application number US13266165, 2012.
`PDF </Papers/2012PatentAppMultiPoint.pdf>`__.
