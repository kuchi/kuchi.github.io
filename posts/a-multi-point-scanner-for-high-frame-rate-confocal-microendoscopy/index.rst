Slit-scanning geometries for confocal microendoscopy represent a compromise
between acquisition rate and optical performance.
Such systems provide high frame rates that freeze motion but recent
Monte Carlo simulations show that scattered light severely limits the
practical imaging depth for in vivo applications. A new multi-point scanning
architecture for confocal microendoscopy has been developed. The new scanner
is based on a relatively simple modification to the slit-scanning geometry that
results in a parallelized point-scanning confocal microendoscope that maintains
the high frame rate of a slit-scanning system while providing optical performance
close to that of a single point scanning system. You can read the details in
the `paper </Papers/2010Confocal.pdf>`__. This paper arose from my
`dissertation </Papers/2009_TanbakuchiDissertation.pdf>`__
and `journal publication </Papers/2009_JBO_Monte_Carlo_Tanbakuchi.pdf>`__ where I was able
to demonstrate through monte-carlo modeling that
a slit scan system could be improved by making a small modification so that it
becomes a multi-point scan system. My contribution was mainly the suggestion
of the multi-point concept, Andy and Houssine did all the hard work.
