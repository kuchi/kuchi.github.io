Since my long time hosting provider BlueHost kept increasing prices and I don't
need any advanced features that they offer, I decided to move my site to Github Pages
since I'm already a Github user.
My site has been statically generated for years. The advantages of a static site are
(1) it makes hosting simple,  (2) it is very secure compared to dynamic sites,
and (3) I am not locked into any platform. I updated my static
generator code to Python based `Nikola <https://getnikola.com>`__ from
Ruby based `WebGen <http://webgen.gettalong.org>`__. I made this change
because I prefer Python and I like the option to be able to include iPython posts.
By making these changes I was able to save about $160/year due to BlueHost's newly
announced major price increases. My only cost now
is my domain registration
since Github Pages are free. Much thanks to the great community services at Github!


All of the content that was available on the previous site is still here. Just
use the menu at the top to access everything.
