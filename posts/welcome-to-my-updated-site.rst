Since my long time hosting provider BlueHost kept increasing prices and I don't
need any advanced features I decided to move my site to a github pages.
My site has been statically generated for years which keeps things simple and
makes migration easy. So moving to Github Pages was simple. I updated my static
generator code to Python based `Nikola <https://getnikola.com>`__ from
Ruby based `WebGen <http://webgen.gettalong.org>`__. I changed the generator code
because I prefer Python and like the option to be able to include iPython posts.
By making these changes I was able to save about $160/year with BlueHosts newly
announced major price increases. My only cost now
is $12 domain registrations using `Google Domains <http://domains.google.com>`__
since Github Pages are free. Thanks Github!
