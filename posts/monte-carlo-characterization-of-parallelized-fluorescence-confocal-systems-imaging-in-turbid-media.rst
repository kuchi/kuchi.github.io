This publication represented 1 of 3 journal articles that comprimised my
`dissertation </Papers/2009_TanbakuchiDissertation.pdf>`__. For this
`paper </Papers/2009_JBO_Monte_Carlo_Tanbakuchi.pdf>`__ I
developed and coded a Monte Carlo model to simulate a confocal system
imaging in tissue to model performance characteristics of the system. The results
showed that a new type of confocal design, a multi-point scanner, would significantly
improve the current design. This resulted in
`a new system <link://slug/a-multi-point-scanner-for-high-frame-rate-confocal-microendoscopy>`__, as well
as a `a patent application <link://slug/novel-multi-point-scan-architecture-patent-application>`__.
