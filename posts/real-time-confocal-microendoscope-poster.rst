    While at the University of Arizona, my colleagues and I were developing
    this instrument in the `Biomedical Imaging Laboratory, Department of
    Radiology <http://bil.arizona.edu>`__. The long term goal of this
    instrument is to replace biopsies with live video images of the cells so
    surgeons can precisely isolate cancerous tumors for resection. You can
    read more about it in my
    `dissertation </Papers/2009_TanbakuchiDissertation.pdf>`__.
