In this paper I present a dual channel 7 degree full field of view f/2.5 athermal
optical design athermalized from 0 to 50 degrees C that operates in the wavelength range of 2.0 to 2.5
microns suitable for methane imaging. The system was designed to image in the field.
I was responsible for the optical design,
tolerance budget, alignment plan, and peformance testing of the system.
Predicted and as-built performance data including interferometric and
ensquared energy measurements for both imaging channels are also shown in the
`paper </Papers/2012Athermal.pdf>`__. The as-built optical system meet the design
requirements and preformed well in the field.
