This was a conference paper that I was a co-author on where we developed a infrared
polarization system for chemical detection.
My contribution was the
design, tolerancing, building, and testing of the optical system. The goal was to
make a low cost short wave thermal imager (SWIR) to test polarization detection
for certain chemicals. You can read the details in the
`paper </Papers/2015PolarizationSystem.pdf>`__. The design was very successful for
the intended application as a first generation prototype. It was optimized
for loose tolerances, easy fabrication of the optical elements, and passive
assembly. By making the optics fit into a commercial telescope focuser and
building some simple custom adaptors we turned something that could have cost many
tens of thousands of dollars into an instrument that was only a few thousand dollars.
Moreover, we were able to utilize rapid prototype parts for the filter holder enabling
us to have more complex parts in that component without driving fabrication costs.
